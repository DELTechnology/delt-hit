# 🧬 `DELT-Hit`

Welcome to `delt-hit`! An end-to-end computational framework for DNA-encoded chemical library analysis.

## 🚀 Installation

This guide provides instructions for setting up `delt-hit` for both regular users and developers.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

#### 1. Conda

We recommend using the [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda) package manager to create an isolated
environment for this project. This ensures that all dependencies are managed correctly.

- [Download and install Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda#latest-miniconda-installer-links) for your
  operating system.
- After installation, you should be able to use the `conda` command in your terminal.

#### 2. R Environment

Some analysis features in `delt-hit` (like enrichment analysis with `edgeR`) depend on R.

- **Install R:** Download and install R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- **Install R Packages:** Once R is installed, open an R console and run the following commands to install the required
  packages:
    ```R
    # Install tidyverse and GGally from CRAN
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "GGally"))

    # Install BiocManager
    if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")

    # Install edgeR and limma from Bioconductor
    BiocManager::install(c("edgeR", "limma"))
    ```

### 🧑‍🔬 User Installation

This is the recommended way for most users.

1. **Create and activate a Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n delt-hit python=3.12 -y
   conda activate delt-hit
   ```
   > 💡 Always activate this environment (`conda activate del`) before using `delt-hit`.

2. **Install `delt-hit`:**
   Install the package directly from GitHub using `pip`:
   ```bash
   conda install pygraphviz -y
   pip install git+https://github.com/DELTechnology/delt-hit.git
   ```
   > **Note:** The `delt-hit` package is under active development. To get the latest version of `cutadapt` required by
   this package, please run `pip install git+https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt.git` (this command can be ignored once
   Cutadapt 4.10 is released).

3. **Verify Installation:**
   Check that the CLI is working:
   ```bash
   delt-hit --help
   ```
   You should see a list of available commands.

### 👩‍💻 Developer Installation

If you want to contribute to the development of `delt-hit`, follow these steps.

1. **Configure SSH for GitHub:**
   Make sure you have
   an [SSH key added to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
   to clone the repository.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:DELTechnology/delt-hit.git
   cd delt-hit
   ```

3. **Create and activate the Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n delt-dev python=3.12 -y
   conda activate delt-dev
   ```

4. **Install in Editable Mode:**
   Install the package with all development and testing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
   ```
   > 🔧 This "editable" install means that any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected when you
   run the `delt-hit` command.

5. **(Optional) Install `pigz` for parallel processing:**
   For faster demultiplexing on macOS, install `pigz` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
   ```bash
   brew install pigz
   ```

## 🧪 Example Workflow

Here is a typical workflow for using `delt-hit`:

1. **Initialize Configuration:**
   Create a `config.yaml` file from an Excel library file. This file defines the experiment, selections, and library
   information.
   ```bash
   delt-hit init --excel_path /path/to/library.xlsx
   ```

2. **Run Demultiplexing:**
   Run the entire demultiplexing pipeline based on your configuration. This includes preparing scripts, running
   `cutadapt`, and processing the results.
   ```bash
   delt-hit demultiplex run --config_path /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

3. **Define Analysis Groups:**
   After demultiplexing, define analysis groups by editing your `config.yaml` file. Add an `analyses` section to group
   selections for comparison. For example:
   ```yaml
   experiments:
   - name: protein_vs_no_protein
     save_dir: experiments/template/analysis
     selections:
       - name: AG24_4
         counts_path: experiments/template/selections/AG24_4/counts.txt
         group: no_protein
       - name: AG24_5
         counts_path: experiments/template/selections/AG24_5/counts.txt
         group: no_protein
       - name: AG24_6
         counts_path: experiments/template/selections/AG24_6/counts.txt
         group: no_protein
       - name: AG24_13
         counts_path: experiments/template/selections/AG24_13/counts.txt
         group: protein
       - name: AG24_14
         counts_path: experiments/template/selections/AG24_14/counts.txt
         group: protein
       - name: AG24_15
         counts_path: experiments/template/selections/AG24_15/counts.txt
         group: protein
     ```

4. **Calculate Enrichment:**
   Calculate enrichment for the defined groups using different methods. The `--name` argument must correspond to a group
   you defined in your `config.yaml`.
   ```bash
   # Using simple counts
   delt-hit analyse enrichment --config_path /path/to/config.yaml --name=protein_vs_no_protein --method=counts

   # Using edgeR for more sensitive statistical analysis
   delt-hit analyse enrichment --config_path /path/to/config.yaml --name=protein_vs_no_protein --method=edgeR
   ```

5. **Work with the Library:**
   Enumerate the library, compute properties, and generate representations.
   ```bash
   # Enumerate all molecules in the library
   delt-hit library enumerate --config_path /path/to/config.yaml

   # Compute chemical properties
   delt-hit library properties --config_path /path/to/config.yaml

   # Generate molecular fingerprints (e.g., Morgan)
   delt-hit library represent --method=morgan --config_path /path/to/config.yaml
   ```

6. **Launch Dashboard:**
   Explore the results interactively in a web-based dashboard.
   ```bash
   delt-hit dashboard \
   --config_path /path/to/config.yaml \
   --counts_path /path/to/selections/SELECTION_NAME/counts.txt
   ```
